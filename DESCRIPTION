Description: Provides the ability to create, compile, and execute shaders from
    within R. The main focus is on the GLSL language due to its cross-platform
    support. The 'shader' package provides native support for passing in R 
    objects as input and uniforms and render to either a window or to a raster 
    in a headless manner.
